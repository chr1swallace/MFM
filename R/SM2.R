#' A list of GUESSFM output for an instance of simulated data 
#'
#' Simulated data was generated using functions in MFMextra. In this example, there are two diseases that each have two
#' causal variants, of which one is shared beween diseases; both have causal variant rs61839660 in
#' group A; disease 1 has additional causal variant rs56382813 in group D; disease 2 has additional causal variant rs11594656 in
#' group C (SNP groups are given in the snpGroups object of this package). There are 3000 each of disease 1, disease 2, 
#' and controls. 
#'
#' List items are "AD" and "AC", which are the GUESSFM output from each disease. Steps to obtain this are given in the vignettes.
#'
