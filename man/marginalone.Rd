\title{Marginal PP for models sharing information between diseases}
\usage{
marginalone(STR, ABF, PP, pr, kappa, p0, tol = 1e-04, eps = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{STR}{list of models for diseases 1, 2, ..., n, each given in
the form of a character vector, with entries
\code{"snp1\%snp2\%snp3"}. The null model is given by
\code{"1"} OR \code{"0"}.  It is assumed that all elements of
ABF, PP and pr below follow this same order.}

\item{ABF}{list of log(ABF) vectors for diseases 1, 2, ...}

\item{PP}{list of posterior probability vectors for diseases 1, 2,
...}

\item{pr}{list of prior probabilities for the models in M}

\item{kappa}{single value or vector of values to consider for the
sharing scale parameter.  the value of kappa=1 must be
included, and if not will be prepended.}

\item{p0}{prior probability of the null model}

\item{eps}{models for all but the first disease are dropped if
their PP < eps.  Ie set PP=0 if PP<eps.  This is an
APPROXIMATION, eps should be as small as your computing
facilities allow.}
}
\value{
list of: - single.pp: list of pp for each model in
STR[[i]] for disease i - shared.pp: list of pp for each model
in STR[[i]] for disease i, - STR: not quite as input,
reordered so null model is first row - ABF: not quite as
input, repordered so null model is first row - kappa: as
supplied

\description{
Calculate marginal model posterior probabilities for one disease
incorporating information from others
}
\details{
Given a list of model matrices and log ABFs, this function
calculates the marginal model posterior probabilities for thr
FIRST disease without ever calculating the joint Bayes Factors for
all cross-disease model configurations, which would require large
amounts of memory.

This aims to be faster than marginalpp by ignoring contributions
from other diseases to models with individual PP < eps.  This is
an approximation, and the effects of having too large an eps may
induce inaccuracies.  However, if you want to pull in information
from several diseases, this may be the only way to do it within
achievable computer time.
