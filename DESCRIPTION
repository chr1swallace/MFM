Title: Multi-trait fine-mapping
Description: A Bayesian multinomial stochastic search with a sharing
	     scale parameter is used to identify the best SNP models
	     for each trait.  The sharing scale is used in the joint
	     prior probabilities to give higher weight to joint models
	     that have at least one shared variant between the
	     traits. The best SNP models are summarised in terms of
	     sets of correlated SNPs that have a similar impact on the
	     trait. This approach is an extension of the GUESSFM
	     software for fine-mapping of single traits and relies on
	     several of the functions from that software.
